Computational Art: Lab 9 (Firework Particle System)

In this lab, I created a particle system that spawns a firework wherever the user clicks.

Particle systems are largely used to represent natural phenomena 
such as snow falling or as you may have seen in my Transformational Story project (Project 4), rainfall.
You might notice, each of the individual particles in a firework  have a lighter opacity and are slight variations in color.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
